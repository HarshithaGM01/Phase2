This project is a backend admin portal for Learnerâ€™s Academy. It enables admin to perform several functions like adding new student or teacher in the existing list or track the class report and many more.
Apart from this, it has a single admin login with which the login page will be reloaded upon password mismatch or wrong credentials with the message saying invalid login.
